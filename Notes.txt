// Lab Tasks:

- Redo this document...convert it to Markdown
- Use normalize.css instead of Meyer reset?
- Covert entire lab to HTML5
- Rewrite intro Page
	-- Lists of things to do	
	-- List of links
	
- Convert to Soalrized
	
- Typography Page
	-- 15px base size (and increased leading) Another branch?
	-- Finish Sidebar
	-- embedded lists
	-- Try in line elsewhere posts
	-- Rather than a figuring out type width, put whatever and set an implicit width in img css? - didn't work
	-- Redo subheadings: too many font sizes - transform to uppercase/sc...bold...italic
	
- New Header?

- Add Lab links to main nav on nealsheeran.com

- Add Mint Code to all pages


Other Projects:
- HTML5 / CSS 3
	-- Text Shadow
- Color (solarized version?)
- Grid layouts
- New horizontal Nav
- Responsive layout

// Current Issues
- Too many text sizes for content sub-headings: 20, 16, 15, + 13px sidebar text
	-- Use all caps (or small caps if available) for sub-headings, but keep same size?
- Monospace font (pre, code) appears as serif font in Google Chrome
- List items (and paras) with code elements appear to 1 pixel too large (21 vs 20), at least with Anonymous Pro and Menlo
- Is all this em math worth it? Go back to pixels? Or least move all font-size/line-height to one section
		


// Closed Issues
4 Jul 11 - emphasized and strong text...wasn't. Was being reset in new Meyer reset
10 Oct 11 - footnotes and sidenotes. still working out maintaining vertical rhythm with hr element
