// Lab Tasks:
- Rewrite intro Page
	-- Lists of things to do	
	-- List of links
	
- Typography Page
	-- Currently, desired font size is separate for 'content' and 'sidebar' (independent, with body=100%/16px). 
	   Could put 14px on 'wrap' and derive all from that. **Make a new branch**
	-- 15px base size (and increased leading) Another branch?
	-- Footnotes and Sidenotes
	-- Finish Sidebar
	-- embedded lists
	
- New Header?

- Add Lab links to main nav on nealsheeran.com

- Add Mint Code to all pages

Other Projects:
- HTML5 / CSS 3
	-- Text Shadow
- Color (solarized version?)
- Grid layouts
- New horizontal Nav
- Responsive layout

// Current Issues
- Margins and sizes on sidebar is off: elements inheriting "#content" math, but sidebar is different.
- Monospace font (pre, code) appears as serif font in Google Chrome
- List items (and paras) with code elements appear to 1 pixel too large (21 vs 20), at least with Anonymous Pro
	and Menlo
- Is all this em math worth it? Go back to pixels?
