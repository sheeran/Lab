Other Projects:

- Grid layouts
- New horizontal Nav

// Current Issues
- Monospace font (pre, code) appears as serif font in Google Chrome
- List items (and paras) with code elements appear to 1 pixel too large (21 vs 20), at least with Anonymous Pro
	and Menlo
- Currently, desired font size is separate for 'content' and 'sidebar' (independent, with body=100%/16px). 
	Could put 14px on 'wrap' and derive all from that
- Is all this em math worth it? Go back to pixels?
