// Lab Tasks:
- Rewrite intro Page
	-- Lists of things to do	
	-- List of links
	
- Typography Page
	-- 15px base size (and increased leading) Another branch?
	-- Footnotes and Sidenotes
	-- Finish Sidebar
	-- embedded lists
	-- Try in line elsewhere posts
	-- Rather than a figuring out type width, put whatever and set an implicit width in img css? - didn't work

- Add Mint Code to all pages

Other Projects:
- HTML5 / CSS 3
	-- Text Shadow

// Current Issues
- Too many text sizes for content sub-headings: 20, 16, 15, + 13px sidebar text
- Monospace font (pre, code) appears as serif font in Google Chrome
- List items (and paras) with code elements appear to 1 pixel too large (21 vs 20), at least with Anonymous Pro
	and Menlo
- Is all this em math worth it? Go back to pixels?
