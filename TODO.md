# Lab Tasks

## Main Lab Page
1. Redo layout: header
2. Break down css into: rest base, layout, type + each specific project
3. Re-write copy: intro, projects, resources, current list
4. Do the footer
5. Images don't work for lab.nealsheeran subdomain - change to full path?

## Typography Page
*Note: use git branches for major changes*

1. Move text size and line-height to one section for easier changing? (or variables with LESS?)
2. Change sidenotes to floats
3. Finish sidebar: "status of page"
4. Try inline Elsewhere posts
5. Multi-line article titles + new headline typeface
6. Text shadow
7. Solarized colors - dark on light?
8. If changing 'code' elements to Georgia, dial down font size
9. Box, padding, border around code elements?

## Typography Page 2

## Prototypes
1. Logo Image won't work at smaller sizes

4. Use display: inline-block instead of floats? http://designshack.net/articles/css/whats-the-deal-with-display-inline-block/
4a. Use box-style: border-box?
