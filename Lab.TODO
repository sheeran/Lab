The Laboratory:

 ☐ Overall HTML structure - portable classes that can be used across entire site:
 Match to Octopress (with redesign going to Octopress)
 Match to New Design and then change Octopress to that?
 * Watch for OP plugin output and don't change if not necessary
  - <div.content> change to 'main'? modularize these "blocks"
    - Blog Home:
      <section.posts-full>                           @12: 6 wide, push 2 + SB 3
        <article>                 @8: 6 wide, push 2 @12: 6 wide, push 2 + SB 3
        <article>
      <section.sidebar>                              @12: 3 wide
    - Single Page:
      <article>                                      @12: 6 wide, push 3 (no SB)                     
      *No Sidebar*
    - Archives Page:
      <section.archives>          @8: 6 wide + SB 2  @12: 8 wide + SB 3
        <ul.test-list> @6: 4w,p2  --> same           @12: 6 wide, push 2
      <section.sidebar>           @8: 2 wide         @12: 3 wide

     --> Need a basic module that is full width at 4,6,8 and 8 cols @12 with 3col sidebar
